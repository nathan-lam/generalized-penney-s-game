# generalized-penney-s-game


Penney's game is a 2 player nontransitive game where the two players make a unique binary sequence of length 3 as a guess to flipping a series H or T with a 50-50 chance.



# Goal
To generalize the game to fit a sequence of length n  
To generalize the game to accomidate m people  
To generalize the game to fit more than a binary state (expanding the base)


# Checklist
1. (Done) Can generate the markov (transition) matrix for any base, any sequence length, and any number of players
2. (Done) Can get the probabilities for any base and any sequence length for any number of players < number of all possible sequences
3. (Done) Finding the best pattern given opponent's patterns
4. (Done) Can simulate the Generalized Penney's game trough a simulation


I'm done exploring this game until something else catches my attention about this game
